### Known issue with Google Meet on Kandao Meeting Pro

- No matter how many times the app is deleted or reset, the error will always be there.

### Diagnosis
- Tried to register the device with GFID provided by Kandao on Google account - no improvement to the issue
- Tried other video call app, such as Zoom/Team, and they are working without any known issue.
- Tried to update the Google Meet via Google Play Store page, when trying to install other app from the Kandao App Store - no improvement to the issue
- Kandao is using a customized Rom of Android 10, and it is **NOT CERTIFIED** by Google Play.

### Instruction
1. Uninstall any Google Meet app from the home screen by a long-hold click on the icon, and choose "Uninstall" from the pop-up menu.
2. Go to Kandao App Store, and click any APP other than Google Meet (like Microsoft Team).
3. In the Google Play page: Click "Search" icon -> type "meet" in the search box -> select "Google Meet"(**NOT the original**, you can tell by the new icon).
4. In the app page, click "Install" and then wait for the installation being finished.
5. Go to Homepage, and then click the Google Meet icon.
6. Following the regualr Android App setup instruction and finish the registration process (depends on how your account setting, such as 2-step verification or other Workspace policy).
7. Once setup is complete, this Google Meet will behave like any regular Android version of Google Meet, by which you can create meeting, invite someone to a meeting or join a meeting.

### Key Takeaway

- Bypassing the Kandao App Store and then use the legit Google Play Store is the key to troubleshoot this issue.
